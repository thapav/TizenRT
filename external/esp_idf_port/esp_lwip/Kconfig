    default y
    help
        this option enable expressif DHCP Server implement.
 
config L2_TO_L3_COPY
    bool "Enable copy between Layer2 and Layer3 packets"
    default y
    help
        If this feature is enabled, all traffic from layer2(WIFI Driver) will be
        copied to a new buffer before sending it to layer3(LWIP stack), freeing
        the layer2 buffer.
        Please be notified that the total layer2 receiving buffer is fixed and 
        ESP32 currently supports 25 layer2 receiving buffer, when layer2 buffer 
        runs out of memory, then the incoming packets will be dropped in hardware. 
        The layer3 buffer is allocated from the heap, so the total layer3 receiving
        buffer depends on the available heap size, when heap runs out of memory,  
        no copy will be sent to layer3 and packet will be dropped in layer2. 
        Please make sure you fully understand the impact of this feature before 
        enabling it.

config LWIP_IRAM_OPTIMIZATION
    bool "Enable LWIP IRAM optimization"
    default n
    help
        If this feature is enabled, some functions relating to RX/TX in LWIP will be
        put into IRAM, it can improve UDP/TCP throughput by >10% for single core mode,
        it doesn't help too much for dual core mode. On the other hand, it needs about
        10KB IRAM for these optimizations.

        If this feature is disabled, all lwip functions will be put into FLASH.

config LWIP_DHCPS_LEASE_UNIT

    default 60
    help
        The DHCP server is calculating lease time multiplying the sent 
        and received times by this number of seconds per unit. 
        The default is 60, that equals one minute.

config LWIP_DHCPS_MAX_STATION_NUM
    int "Maximum number of stations"
    range 1 64
    default 8
    help
        The maximum number of DHCP clients that are connected to the server.
        After this number is exceeded, DHCP server removes of the oldest device
        from it's address pool, without notification.
