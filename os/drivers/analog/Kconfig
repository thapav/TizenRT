config ADC
	bool "Analog-to-Digital Conversion"
	default n
	---help---
		Select to enable support for analog input device support.  This includes
		not only Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADC) but also amplifiers and
		analog multiplexers.

		This selection enables:

			- The upper half, device-independent ADC character driver, and
			- Selection of common lower half ADC drivers.

		MCU-specific, lower half drivers may be selected independently of
		CONFIG_ADC.  However, if CONFIG_ADC is selected, then it is assume
		that lower half ADC drivers will be used only with the common ADC
		upper half driver.

if ADC

config ADC_FIFOSIZE
	int "ADC buffer size"
	default 8
	---help---
		This variable defines the size of the ADC ring buffer that is used
		to queue received ADC data until they can be retrieved by the
		application by reading from the ADC character device.  NOTE:  Since
		this is a ring buffer, the actual number of bytes that can be
		retained in buffer is (ADC_FIFOSIZE - 1).

config ADC_NPOLLWAITERS
	int "Number of poll waiters"
	default 2
	depends on !DISABLE_POLL
	---help---
		Maximum number of threads that can be waiting on poll.

endif # ADC

config DAC
	bool "Digital-to-Analog Conversion"
	default n
	---help---
		Select to enable support for Digital-to-Analog Converters (DACs).
