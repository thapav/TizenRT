config PARTITION_TABLE_OFFSET
    hex "Offset of partition table"
    default 0x8000
    help
        The address of partition table (by default 0x8000).
        Allows you to move the partition table, it gives more space for the bootloader.
        Note that the bootloader and app will both need to be compiled with the same PARTITION_TABLE_OFFSET value.

        This number should be a multiple of 0x1000.

        Note that partition offsets in the partition table CSV file may need to be changed if this value is set to a higher value. To have
        each partition offset adapt to the configured partition table offset, leave all partition offsets blank in the CSV file.
