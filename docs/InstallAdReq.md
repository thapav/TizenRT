# Additional Requirements

To use below features, each prerequisite is required.  
The configure.sh also shows missed package to build configure as shown below:
```bash
os$ ./tools/configure.sh artik053/grpc
  Copy build environment files
 
  CAUTION!! To build artik053/grpc, protoc should be installed
  Find details at https://github.com/Samsung/TizenRT/blob/master/external/protobuf/README.md
 
  Configuration is Done!
```
All of these documentations are listed in our [wiki userguide](https://github.com/Samsung/TizenRT/wiki/Documentations#user-guide).

## gRPC
Please refer [gRPC prerequisites](https://github.com/Samsung/TizenRT/blob/master/external/grpc/README.md#pre-requisites).

## ROMFS
Please refer [How to use ROMFS](https://github.com/Samsung/TizenRT/blob/master/docs/HowToUseROMFS.md).

## OCF
Please refer [Getting Started of IoTivity](https://iotivity.org/documentation/linux/getting-started).

## IoT.js
There is a README, [How to use IoTjs](https://github.com/Samsung/TizenRT/blob/master/docs/HowToUseIoTjs.md).  
But it does not show necessity of cmake. Please refer [Build for STM32F4-NuttX](https://github.com/Samsung/iotjs/wiki/Build-for-STM32F4-NuttX#linux).
